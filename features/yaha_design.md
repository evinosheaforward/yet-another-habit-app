# Guiding Principles for yet-another-habit-app

The goal of yet another habit app is to allow users to be able to easily track repeatable habits.

The goal will be to allow the user to create types of activites and asign them as daily, weekly, or monthly.

## activity tracking / history

Ideally, the user can track the number of times they did something - with a goal.
Example: brush teeth twice a day
the user would create "brush teeth" daily and it would have a goal of 2
then when the user looks at that activity, they can increment or decrement the number of occurances

activites have a history for a given day, week, or month
activities are presented to the user _using_ the combination of the activities table and the activities history. This will show all their activies and then the current progress on the latest day/week/month. This is nice because it means the status of activities will rotate automatically when the day/week/month ends

nice to have: user can select the time of day which counts as "new day"

## activities history visualizations

in the drop-down for an activity, the user will be able to see a history - either through calendar or chart view that shows their history with that habit, how good they have been with it over the days/weeks
