# Scheduled todos

Given we have the ability to schedule habits to days of the week, I want to now be able to schedule habits using a calendar-like interface AND I want to be able to schedule tasks as well

## Scheduling TODOS

The user can currently schedule habits, which will auto-add to the todo list for that day of the week.
I want to add the ability for a user to add a task to a day of the week - it will add to that day's todo list when populated, and then will _remove_ the item from that day's schedule. This way I can schedule "visit the dentist" for thursday - it gets added to my todo list on this thursday, but then isn't added to my todo list next thursday.

## Calendar scheduling

Calendar scheduling: this will be an additional tab on the "day of week" schedule for todos. The user will be able to see a calendar, and can add tasks / habits to specific days - these will only be added to that one day. This will allow the user to create a scheduled event or schedule monthly/ weekly habits for future days, while retaining the ability to schedule their weeky tasks.
