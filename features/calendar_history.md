# Detailed + Calendar history

We want to add a more detailed history page to our habit app - this is where the real info lies.

On the details page for an activity - we want to be able to go to "detailed history"

here, the user would be able to choose between a calendar heat map or bar chart (we already have the bar chart).
For the calendar heat map, they should choose which month to view, and then they would see a heat map of the activity for the days in that month.

activity not created yet (if we have that data): gray
No activity (0%): red
some activity (between 0 and 100%): yellow
complete (100% or more): green

For the bar chart, the user would be able to select the number of days they want to see plotted. We should include the "goal count" as well.

for both bar and history, create a "graph it" button so the user can submit the query to graph only when they configure the options.

In terms of UI, this should be a stack with the details page, so if the user goes back - then end up on the details page for the habit.
