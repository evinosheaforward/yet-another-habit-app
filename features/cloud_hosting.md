# Cloud hosting setup

For this feature we want to host our react native website and its backend on a cloud instance.

First, we will need to make it so the app/website can be pointed at the backend.

Then, we need to get the backend running on our instance.

Lastly, we need to get the website/app to run on our server.

For now, everything can use an AWS EIP.
