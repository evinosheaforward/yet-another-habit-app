# Ads feature

I want a very simple ads in the app. I'd like to have google adds in the app on the home page. Not a popup and not blocking, just an ad at the middle-bottom of the page where there is currently only blank space anyways.

we can use google ads - I'm not sure if those would work on IOS or not, but thats not a huge issue.
