# Ads feature

I want a very simple ads in the app. I'd like to have google ads in the app on the home page as a banner, at the middle-bottom of the page where there is currently only blank space anyways.

we can use google ads - we will want this to work with test ids for dev, but we need a plan for using the real ad id in production.

I want to make sure this works for mobile and web while using expo + react/react-native so please build out a solution that works for both, if possible.
