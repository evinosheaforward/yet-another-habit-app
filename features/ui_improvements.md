# UI Improvements

There are some minor UI improvements we want to make:

- the increment/decrement on the activities page shoudl be replaced with just a "complete" button (the complete button is the increment button, but it says "complete" and has a green background) - the details page is where a user can decrement
- move the history view above the configuration on the details page. Add a "settings" header between the history and the settings (i.e. title and goal count)
